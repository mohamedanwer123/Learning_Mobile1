To create toolbar items, use the UIBarButtonItem class. To add toolbar items to a toolbar, use the setItems(_:animated:) method.
Toolbar images that represent normal and highlighted states of an item derive from the image you set using the inherited image property from the UIBarItem class. The image is colored with the toolbar’s tintColor.
If you need radio button style controls, use the UITabBar class instead of UIToolbar.
Customizing Appearance
You use the methods listed in Customizing Appearance to customize the appearance of toolbars. You send the setter messages to the appearance proxy ([UIToolbar appearance]) to customize all toolbars, or to a specific UIToolbar instance. When a property is dependent on the bar metrics, you should typically specify a value for default as well as for landscapePhone.
