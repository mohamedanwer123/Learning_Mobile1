Pre-commercial release versions
The development of Android started in 2003 by Android, Inc., which was purchased by Google in 2005.[16]

Alpha
There were at least two internal releases of the software inside Google and the OHA before the beta version was released.[17][18] The code names "Astro Boy" and "Bender" were used internally for some pre-1.0 milestones.[2]

Dan Morrill created some of the first mascot logos, but the current Android logo was designed by Irina Blok.[19] The project manager, Ryan Gibson, conceived the confectionery-themed naming scheme that has been used for the majority of the public releases, starting with Android 1.5 Cupcake.

Beta
The beta was released on November 5, 2007,[20][21] while the software development kit (SDK) was released on November 12, 2007.[22] The November 5 date is popularly celebrated as Android's "birthday".[23] Public beta versions of the SDK were released in the following order:[24]

November 12, 2007: m3-rc20a (milestone 3, release code 20a)[25]
November 16, 2007: m3-rc22a (milestone 3, release code 22a)[26]
