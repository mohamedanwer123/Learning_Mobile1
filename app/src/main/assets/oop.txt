Java is an Object-Oriented Language. As a language that has the Object-Oriented feature, Java supports the following fundamental concepts -

Polymorphism
Inheritance
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Classes
Objects
Instance
Method
Message Parsing
Object - Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors – wagging the tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

Class - A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.
Objects in Java
Let us now look deep into what are objects. If we consider the real-world, we can find many objects around us, cars, dogs, humans, etc. All these objects have a state and a behavior.

If we consider a dog, then its state is - name, breed, color, and the behavior is - barking, wagging the tail, running.

If you compare the software object with a real-world object, they have very similar characteristics.

Software objects also have a state and a behavior. A software object's state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods.

So in software development, methods operate on the internal state of an object and the object-to-object communication is done via methods.
