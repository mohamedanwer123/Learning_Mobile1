(Polymorphism)

Definition:
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.


Example
Let us look at an example.
public interface Vegetarian{}
public class Animal{}
public class Deer extends Animal implements Vegetarian{}
Now, the Deer class is considered to be polymorphic since this has multiple inheritance. Following are true for the above examples -
•	A Deer IS-A Animal
•	A Deer IS-A Vegetarian
•	A Deer IS-A Deer
•	A Deer IS-A Object
When we apply the reference variable facts to a Deer object reference, the following declarations are legal .

Example
Deer d = new Deer();
Animal a = d;
Vegetarian v = d;
Object o = d;
All the reference variables d, a, v, o refer to the same Deer object in the heap.
